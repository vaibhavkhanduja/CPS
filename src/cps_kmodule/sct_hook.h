| In case we are on IA32 system we need to get the identifier for both x64    |
| and x86 archs. And we can't do that only with #include <asm/unistd.h>       |
| because this way we'll only get the identifiers of one of the archs, the    |
| one that we're currently compiling on.                                      |
| Also, even if we could trick somehow the compiler to include both           |
| identifiers, there is another problem: we will get different values with    |
| the same name.                                                              |
| Example: __NR_read and __NR_read, both have the same name, but on           |
| x86 it's value is N, while on x64 it's value is M. That's why we need to do |
| some magic.                                                                 |
| When we're on x64 and ia32 emulation is enabled, we'll search for the       |
| <asm/unistd_32.h> file, replace all "__NR_xxx" with "__NR32_xxx" and then   |
| use them for the ia32 syscall table.                                        |

| Each fake syscall function should have access to the result of the real     |
| syscall call. This macro gives access to that result value by accessing the |
| stack of the caller. Each fake syscall is called from it's stub. Each stub  |
| reserves 28 bytes on the stack. 4 bytes for the syscall result and 24 bytes |
| for the 6 arguments that a syscall can have. The first 4 bytes are the ones |
| that this macro accesses. We know (guaranteed because of how the stub works)|
| that there isn't anything else on the stack, so we can play with it without |
| any real danger. To access those first 4 bytes we need to keep in mind a    |
| few things. There are 4 bytes on the stack for the return address. Also,    |
| when the fake syscall is called, the EBP value is pushed on the stack,      |
| which means 4 more bytes. That means that if we get the current EBP and add |
| it 8 + 8 we'll get directly into the caller's stack, which is what we want. |
| From there on, we only need to add yet another 6 * 4 bytes and we'll reach  |
| the syscall return value. Please have a look at stubs.S for an actual       |
| graphic representation of how the stack looks like when a stub is being     |
| executed.                                                                   |

| NOTE: Don't confuse the way the stack works. We need to ADD 8 bytes         |
| instead of REST 8 bytes because the stacks grows downwards. Also note that  |
| this explanation is valid for x86 platforms. On x64 we'll have RAX instead  |
| of EAX, RBP instead of EBP, the return value will take 8 bytes and a push   |
| will take another 8 bytes, so that will make 16 bytes in total.             |
|                                                                             |
| NOTE: Keep in mind that we are reading 4 bytes (8 bytes on x64) from the    |
| stack, which can contain a value or an address. It's up to you to know what |
| the real syscall will return. If the returned value fits in 4 bytes, you    |
| just pass a variable to this macro. If the syscall returns a pointer, then  |
| you'll need to pass this macro a pointer.                                   |
